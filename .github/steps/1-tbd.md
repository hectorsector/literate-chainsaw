## Step 1: Removing sensitive data

_Welcome to "TBD-course-name"! :wave:_

`.env` files usually contain sensitive content. For this course, we'll work on removing that file and all traces in the Git history. The first step is to remove the file from repository. We'll alter the history later. We'll assume you're using the GitHub.com web interface, but you can complete the course using your preferred tooling.

### :keyboard: Activity: Remove `.env` in the project root directory

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. Select `.env` from the root directory.
1. Use the ellipsis at the top-right of the page to delete the file. See [Deleting a file on GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/deleting-files-in-a-repository#deleting-a-file) if you need additional help.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
